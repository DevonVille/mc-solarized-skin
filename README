Solarized skin for Midnight Commander
-------------------------------------

This is a skin for Midnight Commander [1] using the Solarized palette [2]. It
is designed to be used with terminal emulators that use Solarized palette as
their ANSI colors [3].

It is a fork from nkulikov/mc-solarized-skin however it was rewriten from
scratch based on GoTaR [4] MC skin. The file highliting was adjusted to be as
close as possible to the Solarized dircolors.ansi-universal [5].

Some info on skin writing is available on MC wiki [6].

Usage
-----

Put the solarized.ini file into the $HOME/.mc directory. Then define MC_SKIN
env variable:
$ export MC_SKIN=$HOME/.mc/solarized.ini
